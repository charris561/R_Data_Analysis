#Homework Assignment 2
#Name: Caleb Harris
#Course: CS 2020-001
#Input Files: Auto.csv from canvas
#----------
# Part A: load Auto.csv file in a variable called Auto
#Install dependencies
packages.install("readr")
install.packages("readr")
#Load library
library(readr)
#Load csv input file
Auto = read_csv("Auto.csv")
#   note: file must be in your working directory to use syntax as done above.
# Part B: What is the type and class of the Auto variable
typeof(Auto)
class(Auto)
View(Auto)
#Part C: Use a R command/function to find the dimensions of the Auto variable
str(Auto)
#Using the above command, we can see that the dimensions of this matrix are 397 X 9
#Part D: Use an R command to remove all NAs from Auto variable. Redo above steps to see new dimensions of Auto variable.
#   Note: There are no NA values directly in Auto as indicated by the "unique()" commands below for each variable, but there are "?" for horsepower. Changing those to NA and removing them for this step.
unique(Auto)
unique(Auto$mpg)
unique(Auto$cylinders)
unique(Auto$displacement)
unique(Auto$horsepower)

#Change the values for horsepower to NA
Auto$horsepower = ifelse(Auto$horsepower == "?", NA, Auto$horsepower)
unique(Auto$horsepower)
Auto = na.omit(Auto)
str(Auto)
#We now see 392 x 9 as the dimensions
#Part E: Use an R command to report the names of all variables in Auto
ls(Auto)
# put the next command before this.....<>
Auto$displacement = as.integer(Auto$displacement)
str(Auto)
#actually didnt need to do the above. Needed horsepower
Auto$horsepower = as.integer(Auto$horsepower)
str(Auto)
#moving on
#Part F: Use attach() function to be able to directly access fields in Auto variable and then plot the cylinders by mpg.
attach(Auto)
plot(cylinders, mpg)
#Part G: convert cylinders field in Auto to a factor and use the plot function to generate a plot of cylinders by mpg.
cylinders = factor(cylinders)
str(cylinders)
plot(mpg, cylinders, col = "#00FF00")
#Part H: Draw a histogram of mpg in Auto using green.
hist(mpg, col = "#00FF00")
#   Note: not sure why I am getting 9 bars when the instructions say there should be 10
#Part I: Use the pairs() function in R to generate a plot matrix, consisting of scatterplots for each variable-combination of "mpg", "displacement", "horsepower", "weight", and "acceleration" fields in Auto variable.
#   Note: Changing the horsepower field to be represented as integers earlier was to enable the pairs function to operate correctly given that it was originally represented as strings due to the "?" value in the data.

#Part J: Report Descriptive Statistics for all fields of Auto variable
